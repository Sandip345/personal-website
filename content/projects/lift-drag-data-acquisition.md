title: Lift & Drag Data Acquisition
period: Jan 2021 – Feb 2021
description: Designed and built an experimental setup using a load cell,
  LabVIEW, and NI DAQmx to acquire lift and drag data for a NACA 0012 airfoil.
  Integrated control and data acquisition hardware to capture force
  measurements, synchronized with flow conditions. Validated experimental
  results through CFD simulations in Ansys, comparing lift and drag coefficients
  across angle of attack ranges and identifying sources of experimental error.
