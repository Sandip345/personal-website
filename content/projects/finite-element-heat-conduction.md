title: Finite Element Heat Conduction
period: Mar 2022 – Apr 2022
description: Enhanced existing MATLAB code for two‑dimensional heat conduction
  using the finite element method. Added functionality to account for internal
  heat sources and included routines to compute both temperature distribution
  and heat flux through the domain. The project improved numerical stability and
  provided additional visualization outputs, making the tool more versatile for
  thermal analysis.
