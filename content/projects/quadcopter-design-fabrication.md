title: Quadcopter Design & Fabrication
period: "2020"
description: Constructed a quadcopter using an Arduino Uno microcontroller and
  off‑the‑shelf components. Implemented PID control algorithms for roll and
  pitch stabilization and tuned parameters to achieve steady hover. Demonstrated
  the quadcopter’s capabilities at MechTRIX‑X, highlighting the integration of
  embedded programming, control theory, and mechanical design.
