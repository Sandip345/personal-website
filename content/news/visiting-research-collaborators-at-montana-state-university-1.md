title: Visiting Research Collaborators at Montana State University
description: I will be traveling to Montana State University to meet with our
  collaborators working on the near-field dynamics of vortex-surface
  interactions. During the visit, I’ll be learning about the flow visualization
  techniques they are using and observing their PIV setup to help replicate a
  similar system at UNH. Looking forward to the opportunity to learn from
  experts in the field.
date: August 3, 2025
